            <h1>Zoom Meetings</h1>



            <p>All technical and plenary sessions, as well as workshops, tutorials, and the DC will be held in Zoom.</p>

            <p>In case you do not want to enter these sessions via gather.town (which is our recommended way of
              attending the conference),
              you can directly access the Zoom meetings listed below.</p>

            <h3>Guidelines for Zoom during the main conference</h3>
            <p>The main conference sessions will be run by Slideslive, our external partner, and will be moderated by a
              session chair.
              Slideslive will stream the pre-recorded videos into the Zoom meeting so that everybody watches the talks
              together.
              The preferred way of asking questions is by doing so directly via audio/video in Zoom, please use the
              "raise hand" feature of
              Zoom to ease the life of the session chair.</p>

            <p>Note that all technical sessions and invited talks are recorded and will be made available online after
                the conference.</p>
